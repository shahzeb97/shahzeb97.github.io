<p>Over the pandemic, I finally took the time to learn how to make a mobile phone app. After reading several articles about the different ways this could be done (native development, React Native, Xamarin, etc.) I settled on using Google’s fresh new (at the time at least) framework for cross-platform app development: <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>.</p>

<p>Flutter is a very straight-forward, Dart-based framework that offered hot-reload, JIT compilation, and a very well-thought-out library of “widgets” that would let me beautify my app. After familiarizing myself with the basics, I wanted to make a simple app with a very distinct look.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved the no name® brand <a href="https://youtu.be/78feeBgCwkA">identity</a>. It’s clean, punchy, delightfully mellow, and shockingly easy to recreate.</p>

<p>I also loved the subtly snarky “tag lines” the marketing team put under certain products. A no name® brand water bottle might be labelled:</p>

<h3 id="water-bottle">water bottle</h3>
<h5 id="for-drinking">for drinking</h5>

<p>With this identity in mind, and using the closest font to Helvetica I could find, I coded up a simple Android app!</p>
