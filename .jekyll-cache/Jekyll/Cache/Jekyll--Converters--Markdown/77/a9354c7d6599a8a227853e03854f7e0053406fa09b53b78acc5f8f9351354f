I"×<p>I am extremely excited to say that my research in <strong>Thermal Management of EV Power Electronics using Metallic Phase Change Materials</strong> was selected as part of the first ever cohort of graduate students to be funded by the University of Torontoâ€™s <a href="https://cpe.utoronto.ca/climate-positive-energy-graduate-student-researchers/">Climate Positive Energy (CPE) Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>This initiativeâ€™s goal is to link science, social science, engineering, economics and policy researchers to transform our energy systems, and I could not be more grateful to the committee for this opportunity. Iâ€™d like to send my humblest thanks to my supervisors <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/amon/">Professor Cristina H. Amon</a> and <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/chandra/">Professor Sanjeev Chandra</a> for their support and guidance. Iâ€™d also like to thank all my lab mates who inspired me throughout this process ðŸ˜Š.</p>

<p>*Below I present the unedited research proposal I submitted to the Climate Positive Energy Committee for their consideration. Iâ€™m finding that research directives can change over time, but</p>
