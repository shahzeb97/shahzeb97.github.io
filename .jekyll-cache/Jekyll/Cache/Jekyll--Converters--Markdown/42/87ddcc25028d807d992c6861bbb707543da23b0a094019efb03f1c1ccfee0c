<p>Over the pandemic, I finally took the time to learn how to make a mobile phone app. After reading several articles about the different ways this could be done (native development, React Native, Xamarin, etc.) I settled on using Google‚Äôs fresh new (at the time at least) framework for cross-platform app development: <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="..\assets\img\noname\flutter.webp" alt="Flutter" class="mx-auto d-block" /></p>

<p>Flutter is a very straight-forward, Dart-based framework that offered hot-reload, JIT compilation, and a very well-thought-out library of ‚Äúwidgets‚Äù that would let me beautify my app. After familiarizing myself with the basics, I wanted to make a simple app with a very distinct look.</p>

<h1 id="the-no-name-appeal">The no name¬Æ Appeal</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve always loved the no name¬Æ brand <a href="https://youtu.be/78feeBgCwkA">identity</a>. It‚Äôs clean, punchy, delightfully mellow, and shockingly easy to recreate.</p>

<p><img src="..\assets\img\noname\noname.webp" alt="no name¬Æ" class="mx-auto d-block" /></p>

<p>I also loved the subtly snarky ‚Äútag lines‚Äù the marketing team put under certain products. A no name¬Æ brand water bottle might be labelled:</p>

<h3 id="water-bottle">water bottle</h3>
<h5 id="for-drinking">for drinking</h5>

<p>With this identity in mind, and using the closest font to Helvetica I could find, I coded up a simple Android app!</p>

<p>Below are some screenshots of the app running on a real world Galaxy S6!</p>

<p>And here are some videos of the app in action (also taken from my old Galaxy S6)! Functionality includes making to-do items, checking and unchecking them, editing items, and deleting them ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ.</p>

<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h1>

<p>I learned so much by making this app, though I know I have a lot more to learn still. Fun factFor simple projects, you don‚Äôt really need to think about architectures (like MVC) and barely need to think about good programming practices. Although the simplicity and speed of development is nice, it really limits how much functionality you can add or if you ever want to add anyone to your team. As the old saying goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go fast alone, go far together</p>

<p>I hope to return to making apps again some day when I have time (maybe a simple game next time ü§î).</p>
