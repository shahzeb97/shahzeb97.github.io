I"z<p>On August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2022, the University of Toronto Climate Positive Energy (CPE) Initiative hosted its first ever <a href="https://cpe.utoronto.ca/cpe-wraps-up-research-day-2022/">Research Day</a>. As part of the cohort of graduate students funded in part through this initiative, I was lucky enough to be able to present a 3-minute presentation outlining my work!</p>

<p>In an earlier <a href="https://shahzeb97.github.io/2022-05-06-cpe/">post</a>, I mentioned that I would be participating in such an event. Presenting was an honor (and a lot of fun) and I’d like to thank the CPE initiative and technicians for making the event possible!</p>
