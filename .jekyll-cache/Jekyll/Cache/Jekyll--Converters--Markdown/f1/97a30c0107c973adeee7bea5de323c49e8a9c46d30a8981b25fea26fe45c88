<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Over the last semester, (<em>the fall of 2021 for you historians</em>), I took a class called ‚ÄúComputational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer‚Äù. Our professor, Dr. Hanif Montazeri, promised a challenging/rewarding experience; frankly, he undersold it. Over the course of 4 months, we hand-crafted our own solvers for the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes Equations</a>. I learned a lot about vector-calculus, discretizing equations, and good programming practice, but most importantly, I made some pretty graphs.</p>

<h2 id="solvers-specifics">Solvers Specifics</h2>

<p>The solver I wrote for this class was written in Python and made extensive use of the SciPy sparse linear algebra library. I used the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm on a co-located grid. This algorithm was first proposed by <a href="https://doi-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.1016/0017-9310(72)90054-3">Patankar and Spalding</a> in 1973 [1] and its implementation on a co-located grid was first described by <a href="https://doi.org/10.2514/3.8284">Rhie and Chow</a> in 1983 [2]. I promise the pretty graphs are coming.</p>

<h2 id="the-principle-problem">The Principle Problem</h2>

<p>The scope of the course was to simulate the famous ‚ÄúLid-Driven Cavity‚Äù flow problem. This is a well-known benchmark for testing fluid simulations and has been studied numerically and experimentally for decades. The idea is to simulate how a fluid would behave in a square box with an open top where fluid was rushing past:</p>

<p><a href="https://doi-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.1016/0021-9991(82)90058-4">Ghia et al.</a> [3] wrote a landmark paper in 1982 studying the problem on a high resolution grid. I used their results to verify the correctness of my own solver, which are the first pretty plots I present below:</p>

<p>It seemed pretty great, and I also conducted a more involved grid independence study and I compared the velocity profiles through the geometric center of the cavity. These graphs are much less interesting, so for now I hope my readers can take my word for it.</p>
