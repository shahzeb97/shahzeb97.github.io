<p>Electric vehicles could be charged a lot faster if we could keep the power electronics cool. What if we did that with melting metals?</p>

<h1 id="the-why">The Why?</h1>
<p>Slow charging speeds are a significant technological barrier which prevent the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). A tremendous amount of heat is generated while an EV is charging. If this heat isnâ€™t managed, it can heat up and damage the electrical components in the charger. Metallic phase change materials (MPCMs) offer a promising way to regulate device temperatures by absorbing excess heat by melting while the vehicle is charging. During the melting process, these materials maintain a nearly constant temperature and can therefore be used prevent excessive temperature spikes. They can then release this heat later by solidifying in cooler conditions.</p>

<h1 id="the-how">The How?</h1>
<p>My project will be to design, build, and test a prototype MPCM-based cooling solution for use in EV power electronics. I will begin by using simulations to estimate the cooling performance of several potential designs. Based on the results of these simulations, the most promising designs will be built using an advanced metal spray coating technique. This technique will allow me to cheaply and quickly fabricate complex, compact cooler designs which are not possible with traditional methods. I will then experimentally test these coolers and iteratively improve on their designs based on my findings. Ultimately, my aim is to maximize the effectiveness of this cooler while minimizing its cost and size.</p>

<p>This work wouldnâ€™t be possible without the support of my professors, <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/chandra/">Dr. Sanjeev Chandra</a> and <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/amon/">Dr. Cristina Amon</a>. It also makes use of the advanced spray coating facility here in the <a href="http://cact.utoronto.ca">CACT Lab</a>.</p>

<h1 id="the-so-what">The So What?</h1>
<p>Canadaâ€™s most recent targets call for all vehicle sales to be electric by 2035. My work could help inform the design of the next generation of EV fast charging cooling systems. This in turn would increase their convenience for users, improve consumer adoption, and allow us to meet our sustainable development goals in time.</p>
