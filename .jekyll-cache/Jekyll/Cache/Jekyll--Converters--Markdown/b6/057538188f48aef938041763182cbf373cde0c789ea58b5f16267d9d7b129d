<p>Over the pandemic, I finally took the time to learn how to make a mobile phone app. After reading several articles about the different ways this could be done (native development, React Native, Xamarin, etc.) I settled on using Google’s fresh new (at the time at least) framework for cross-platform app development: <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>.</p>

<p>Flutter is a very straight-forward, Dart-based framework that offered hot-reload, JIT compilation, and a very well-thought-out library of “widgets” that would let me beautify my app. After familiarizing myself with the basics, I wanted to make a simple app with a very distinct look.</p>
