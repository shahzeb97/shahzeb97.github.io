<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Over the last semester, (<em>the fall of 2021 for you historians</em>), I took a class called ‚ÄúComputational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer‚Äù. Our professor, Dr. Hanif Montazeri, promised a challenging/rewarding experience; frankly, he undersold it. Over the course of 4 months, we hand-crafted our own solvers for the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes Equations</a>. I learned a lot about vector-calculus, discretizing equations, and good programming practice, but most importantly, I made some pretty graphs.</p>

<p>The solver I wrote for this class was written in Python and made extensive use of the SciPy sparse linear algebra library. The 
As of writing this post, there are several dozen medium articles, youtube videos, and open source projects which explain how</p>

<p>The scope of the course was to simulate the famous ‚ÄúLid-Driven Cavity‚Äù flow problem. This is a well-known benchmark for testing fluid simulations and has been studied numerically and experimentally for decades. Ghia et al. [1] in particular, wrote a landmark paper in 1982 studying the problem on a high resolution grid.</p>
