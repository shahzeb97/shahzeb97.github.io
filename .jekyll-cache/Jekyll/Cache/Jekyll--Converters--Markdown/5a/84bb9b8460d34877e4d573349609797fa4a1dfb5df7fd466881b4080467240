I"À<p>I am extremely excited to say that my research in <strong>Thermal Management of EV Power Electronics using Metallic Phase Change Materials</strong> was selected as part of the first ever cohort of graduate students to be funded by the University of Torontoâ€™s <a href="https://cpe.utoronto.ca/climate-positive-energy-graduate-student-researchers/">Climate Positive Energy (CPE) Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>This initiativeâ€™s goal is to link science, social science, engineering, economics and policy researchers to transform our energy systems, and I could not be more grateful for this opportunity. Iâ€™d like to send my humblest thanks to</p>
