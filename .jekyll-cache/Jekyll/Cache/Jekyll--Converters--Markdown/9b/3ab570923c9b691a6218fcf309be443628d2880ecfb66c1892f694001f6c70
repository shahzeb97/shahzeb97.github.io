I"ü<p>I am extremely excited to say that my research in <strong>Thermal Management of EV Power Electronics using Metallic Phase Change Materials</strong> was selected as part of the first ever cohort of graduate students to be funded by the University of Toronto‚Äôs <a href="https://cpe.utoronto.ca/climate-positive-energy-graduate-student-researchers/">Climate Positive Energy (CPE) Initiative</a>.</p>

<p>This initiative‚Äôs goal is to link science, social science, engineering, economics and policy researchers to transform our energy systems, and I could not be more grateful to the committee for this opportunity. I‚Äôd like to send my humblest thanks to my supervisors <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/amon/">Professor Cristina H. Amon</a> and <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/chandra/">Professor Sanjeev Chandra</a> for their support and guidance. I‚Äôd also like to thank all my lab mates who inspired me throughout this process üòä.</p>

<p>In the future, I hope to participate via a research presentation, in at least one Climate Positive Energy workshop, so look out for that post when it comes, dear readers.</p>

<p><em>Update: It happened! See this link for the post!</em></p>

<h1 id="my-research-proposal">My Research Proposal</h1>

<p><em>Below I present the unedited research proposal I submitted to the Climate Positive Energy Committee for their consideration. I‚Äôm finding that research directives can change over time, but this still largely captures the essence of my work.</em></p>

<h4 id="background">Background:</h4>

<p>With increasing charging speeds and higher power demands in electric vehicles (EVs), it becomes increasingly challenging to manage the waste heat generated by the EV power electronics [1].
These small chip-like devices manage the flow of electrical energy within the vehicle and become dramatically less efficient (even failing catastrophically) at high temperatures.
At the same time, federal governments, energy companies, and manufacturers have set goals to increase the power density of power electronic subsystems by over 5x in the coming years to make charging quicker and more convenient for end users [2].
This immense pressure to shrink is pushing traditional, steady-state cooling systems to the limit; however, these systems are also generally intended for worst-case conditions and tend to be overdesigned compared to the average heat loads [1].
The time-varying nature of power electronic systems makes them wellsuited to novel transient thermal management strategies [3], [4].
One transient strategy involves the use of phase change materials (PCMs), which can absorb excess heat by melting during a transient heat spike while maintaining a nearly constant temperature [5].
PCMs offer a simple, passive solution to thermal management and have been adopted in building applications; however, little research has explored their use for power electronic applications and experimental verification of these studies is even more sparse [5].</p>
