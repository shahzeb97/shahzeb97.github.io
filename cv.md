# Work Experience

**Mechanical Engineering Student, Static Equipment Engineering Albian Site, [CNRL](https://www.cnrl.com/)**  
May 2020 - December 2020  
* Supported the safe and reliable operation of static equipment at major oil sands downstream site including ore prep, extraction, froth treatment, and utilities
* Created and maintained database of properties of 40+ onsite shell‑and‑tube heat exchangers to calculate bolt torque requirements, inform future maintenance procedures, support failure root cause analyses, and reduce equipment downtime.
* Developed automated tools to perform critical piping design calculations aligned with ASME B31.3 and ASME BPVC codes, reducing required engineering time by 50‑90%.

**Project Coordinator, Morinville School Team [Aman Builders](https://www.amanbuilders.ca/)**  
August 2019 - December 2019  
* Coordinated schedules, communications, and budgets between owners, consultants, sub‑trades, and suppliers for a new $15M school construction project, and established good working relationships with new partners during tender process for upcoming projects.
* Diligently tracked daily progress and ensured all deadlines were met up to final inspection and occupancy handover.

**Engineering Student, Fleet and Facility Services, [City of Edmonton](https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/fleet-and-facility-services)**  
April 2018 - December 2018
* Assisted the maintenance and general engineering support for fleet of 5000+ municipal vehicles, including designing modifications, developing preventive maintenance strategies, and issuing repair procedures to ensure safe and reliable operation.
* Investigated fleet‑wide trends in lawnmower malfunctions for senior engineers and developed recommendations to increase availability by 20%.
* Implemented new system to routinely measure heavy diesel truck emissions to ensure compliance with EPA regulations.

**Research Associate, University of Alberta, [DTECL](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dnobes/research_1.html)**  
April 2017 - December 2017  
* Experimentally studied novel low‑temperature Stirling engine designs for geothermal energy generation from low‑grade heat sources, supervised by [Dr. David Nobes](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/dnobes) ([dTECL](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dnobes/index.html)) and funded by NSERC undergraduate student research award.
* Developed custom second‑order engine model in MATLAB to study engine performance and optimize engine geometry
