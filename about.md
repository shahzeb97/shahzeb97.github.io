# About Me

Hello friends ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹. My name is Shahzeb Mirza and I am a graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in the [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/). My research is in exploring the use of metallic phase change materials for thermal management applications in power electronics. I am co-supervised by the illustrious [Dr. Sanjeev Chandra](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/chandra/) and the distinguished [Dr. Cristina H. Amon](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/amon/). I have [various](https://shahzeb97.github.io/tags/#research) posts going into more detail about my research, so feel free to check them out!

# About the Website

This website is an actively updated collection of my research and the projects I've worked on. Every page should load quickly since it is a [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator. The website is built using the [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme, though it has been customized somewhat to my liking, and I have added a few features of my own. The source code for this website is available on my GitHub!

I've tried to make this website as accessible as possible! The website is designed to be extremely mobile-friendly and should look good on all platforms. As well, images are all hosted using the very efficient [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) format so all pages should load lightning fast âš¡.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to contact me using any of the links in the footer! I hope you enjoy your stay!
