# Quickly Now!

A lot of things since my last post in *checks notes* 10 month?! Goodness. 

I plan on expanding on some of these posts, but the big ticket items are:

* I signed on with a startup in the Bay Area! We're still in stealth mode so more on that later. I've been working with them and moved down to beautiful Sunnyvale, CA. The weather is ridiculously good and the work is super exciting.

* I wrote and defended my Master's Thesis! I'm now a Master of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto.

* I presented a paper at ITherm 2021! This included a poster session and a 10 minute presentation. I'll post more about this later as well!

* I submitted a journal paper to the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer! This is a big one, but it's still in the peer review process, so (wait for it) I'll post more about this later ðŸ˜….
