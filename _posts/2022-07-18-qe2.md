subtitle: A Short Letter of Thanks
---

I am beyond excited to announce that I have been [awarded](https://atoms.mie.utoronto.ca/news/#Aug8-2022) the Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology (QEII‐GSST) for the 2022-2023 year for my work in thermal management strategies for electric vehicles (EVs).

The QEII‐GSST is a merit-based award funded in part by the [Ministry of Colleges and Universities](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-colleges-universities) and in part by the private sector to encourage excellence in graduate studies. It can't be said enough that awards like these make a huge difference in any graduate student's life. We live in difficult times, so I can't thank the award donors enough for their support ❤.
