# Going Back to an Old Well

I haven't made a new post in some time now. I was hoping to update this blog every once in a while with new projects, papers, and proclivities. Unfortunately, I underestimated how busy I'd be and how motivated I'd be to set time aside for a new project. My winter semester is over and the spring of 2022 seems to be delayed; I'm at a delightful intersection where no one expects anything from me and I can't do much outside anyway. I'm sitting in my parents' lawn, watching our cats, and I want to make something.

I don't have the time to make something from scratch, but I do have one old project I wanted to remake: the Wikipedia Network Research Assistant. I wrote this tool in Python when I first learned the language almost 2 years ago, and I'm sure I made it suboptimally. As a fun idea, I thought I could log my stream of consciousness as I rediscover my old work, and try to make it better.

# The Wikipedia Network Research Assistant (WNRA) Concept

(*Not to be confused with the Women's National Rifle Association*)

The premise here was simple:

1. Ask the user for a term
2. Look up the Wikipedia article for that term
3. Using some heuristic, figure out a list of the most commonly related terms
4. Recursively figure out what terms are related to those terms (with a configurable depth and breadth of the search)
5. Visualize the results

I used the first libraries I could find for this kind of task: [Wikipedia-API](https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API) to scan the Wikipedia pages and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to visualize the results in a network plot. After about 90 lines of code, I was really happy with the results, presented below:

<!-- ![Now that's a lot of latin](..\assets\img\wiki\old\Cactus.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<figcaption align = "center"><i>Cactus</i></figcaption> -->

![](..\assets\img\wiki\old\cat.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<figcaption align = "center"><i>Cat</i></figcaption>

<!-- ![](..\assets\img\wiki\old\OmShantiOm.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

<!-- ![](..\assets\img\wiki\old\PostMalone.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<figcaption align = "center"><i>Post Malone</i></figcaption> -->

![](..\assets\img\wiki\old\TaylorSwift.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<figcaption align = "center"><i>Taylor Swift</i></figcaption>

![](..\assets\img\wiki\old\Toronto.webp){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<figcaption align = "center"><i>Toronto</i></figcaption>

There are a few things that stick out to me about the results here:

1. It's unreadable (I guess I didn't care to look any deeper in the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library to make text a little more legible)

2. The way networks form is surprisingly pleasing to the eye, even though I didn't spend any effort on this part. Shout-out to the developers of [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/).

3. I could apply this to other APIs: [Elsevier](https://github.com/ElsevierDev/elsapy), [IEEE](https://developer.ieee.org/Python_Software_Development_Kit), and [Google Scholar](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly) all seem to have some sort of API accessible through Python (even if they are not official).

4. Kanye West does not show up in Taylor Swift's network. I could have sworn he did ðŸ¤”. Interestingly, the songs that *do* appear in her network are a cool window into the past.

5. There's no child nodes that connect to each other. Did I forget to program that in or is that somehow just how these results look? My guess is I forgot. 

6. There's no visual indication here of whether there is a two-way connection between parent nodes and their children. In other words, there's no way to know if a node is the child of its own children. In other words, is a node [its own grandparent?](https://youtu.be/lxL9dl1zR0o?t=75)

I will stop myself before I get too deep into potential improvements. That well would never end.

# Timeline of Remaking

### 4:45 PM

I've come back inside the house; the outdoors is no place for srs bsns like this. I have my old code open, and the first thing I notice is I didn't stop at the network plots, apparently I also made a little **Command Line Game** for people to try and get from Wikipedia article A to B. It's not very difficult, but I like the concept. There's also a **Wikipedia Summary Exporter** which uses the Wikipedia-API in the most basic way to export the page's summary. I guess I was experimenting before I dove deeper in.

I also found a list of TODO items for my original network graph in the comments. This is so interesting, past Shahzeb and I really do think alike:

~~~
'''
Information to Embed in graph
1. Word Count of Article (Size of Node)
2. Date Article was created (Transparency of Node)
3. Degrees of Separation from Initial (Colour of Node/Edge)
4. Number of cross-references between articles (Thickness of edge)
'''
~~~

These are pretty good ideas, I'll steal them.

If I remake this, what am I going to improve exactly? The code does the job. I will focus on improving the heuristics I use to make the graphs, and then improve the readability of the plots.

### 5:45 PM

I took a long break, now I can actually begin the code. As I read through the official docs, its becoming clear to me that there are [several](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Client_code) client APIs for the official [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). I guess people make it their pet project to do this kind of thing. The API I used earlier must have just been the first google result, and I didn't know enough about APIs to dig further. Honestly, it was definitely the right call to just find the first thing that worked and get a result.

This time, I think I'll do my homework. It seems like [PyWikiBot](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot) is the most up-to-date and powerful wrapper, useful for those who want to make bots to edit/monitor pages (*Seems entirely too dense for my purposes*). [PyWikiApi](https://github.com/nyurik/pywikiapi) is a minimalistic library for the core MediaWiki API written by the original author (*seems powerful, but the syntax and API calls seem a little complex*). [Wikipedia](https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia) is the most popular API, though it hasn't been updated in some time. Still, I think the last one is the best option since I don't need to be a Wikipedia API pro at the end of this, and I really just want something working. Move fast and break things, like the saying goes.

Things are going well, I'm taking a break to fix my fridge
