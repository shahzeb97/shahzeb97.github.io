## Experience 💼

### Sr. Mechanical Design Engineer, Tesla, Palo Alto, CA
January 2026 - Present

- *The future is bright :)*

### Product Engineer - Conifer Inc., Sunnyvale, CA
October 2024 - December 2025

- Led the development from concept to customer pilot of a novel 230/460 V, 1.5 HP EC motor. Worked with cross-functional team of electromagnetic and mechanical design engineers leveraging robust Arena PLM system, while ensuring compliance with UL 1004 and IE5 efficiency standards.
- Conducted comprehensive design optimization on stators and rotors, including reduced-order modeling, DFM/DFA reviews, and FEA, ultimately reducing BOM costs by 50%, increasing efficiency by 5%, and improving power density by 30%.
- Validated in-house, reduced-order motor performance models for torque, back EMF, power factor, current draw, various EM/mechanical losses, and thermal resistances with statistical confidence.
- Prepared 50+ detailed assembly and part drawing packages for global manufacturers and tier 1/2 suppliers in accordance with ASME Y14.5 standards, while collaborating with industrial design partners to meet aesthetic requirements of final product.
- Brought up high-voltage dyno testing station with safe and automated testing capabilities and standardized EOL and accelerated life testing procedures to ensure product longevity and reliability for 40,000+ hrs.

### Thermal Engineer - Conifer Inc., Sunnyvale, CA
May 2023 - September 2024

- Engineered the thermal and mechanical design for a line of 48-72 V and 250-400 A air-cooled automotive inverters experiencing 120+ W/cm2 heat fluxes, leveraging Ansys Electronics Desktop to optimize PCB layout, heat sink, and enclosure design, ultimately reducing board footprint by 30% and product weight by 40%.
- Worked with a cross-functional team of power electronics, layout, and software/firmware engineers to meet thermal requirements while minimizing EMI, transient voltage spikes, current sensing error, and current ripple/imbalance.
- Developed thermal testing procedures to validate conduction/switching loss models for inverters with statistical confidence, leading to improved device selection and thermal derating strategies that reduced the number of required MOSFETs from 12 to 6 while maintaining 90% of the original power output.
