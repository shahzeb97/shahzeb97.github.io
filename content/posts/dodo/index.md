# (The) Games Den Quick 2021

In November 2021, I participated in my first ever game jam, hosted by [The Games Den](https://alberta.campuslabs.ca/engage/organization/thegamesden), a student group from the University of Alberta with a shared passion for video games. My friend, [Boris](https://struckdown.github.io/), was a long time member of the group and knew I was recently exploring the godot engine - so he invited me to the jam! Although I had very little experience with game development (or working in a team programming environment in general, for that matter), I jumped at the chance

The event was named [(The) Games Den Quick 2021](https://itch.io/jam/tgdq-21) and was a great success! Over 24 hours 10 submissions were made, and I highly recommend checking them out! The theme this year was "Dash", which readers will see as a common theme in the entries in the link above.

# The Godot Engine

The Godot Engine is a free and open source game engine which is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and can make applications for Android and iOS as well! It seems to be a very powerful engine which is capable of creating 2D and 3D games, and has a shockingly cohesive user interface and workflow. I respect the hell out of the lead developers for their efforts on the engine and their documentation.

Fun fact: Tesla uses the Godot Engine for their car visualizations and in their mobile app! Some [job postings](https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/mobile-app-front-end-ui-engineer-react-native-tesla-app-energy-104563) on their website even mention it.

# The Game

Our team's brainstorming session went in a LOT of directions, but if I had to [shake the tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking), here is how it went:

Dash ➡ (Pun/Alliteration) Dash of the Dodo ➡ Dash from the Dutch ➡ The Last Dodo

And *voilà*, a game about the last dodo bird trying to escape extinction from a tyrannical Dutchman was born!

# The Team

I loved my team, thank you to all of them for carrying me through this first step into the world of game development!

[Boris](http://struckdown.itch.io/)- Lead, Programming God

[Andrew](http://andrewli.site/) - UI, AI, Savant

[Samuel] - The Worlds Best Artist!

[Chih-Hung] - Sound Engineer Extraordinaire

# The Code

The code for the game is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Struckdown/GDQ2021)

But I encourage playing the game first, it's a lot more fun that way!
