## The Money Shot

## Product Launch!

I won't be writing in great detail about this product, since we are being slow and methodical with the drip of information here at Conifer. I can point to a few resources where we can talk about publically avaialble info:

[Conifer's Website](https://www.conifer.io/product/nema-motors).

[Conifer's LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/coniferio_conifer-cypress-ecmotor-ugcPost-7354181172177842178-YELx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACCWljQBcGokvBab3TiX7bhkhSlmns5Fp9E)

This product is my baby, from first paper studies to design, assembly, and testing. Its been a really quick journey and a lot of learning. Without getting too into the details of tech specs (which I likely can't divulge yet anyway), I can say that this motor is special because:

* It looks cool af

* No rare earth magnets

* Very effiecient

* Runs pretty cool

* Not even close to maxed out on performance

* Designed for manufacturability at scale

* Configurable voltage!

Here's to the future!
