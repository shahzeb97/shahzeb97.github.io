After nearly an entire year from first submission, dear reader I am delighted to inform you that my first ever journal paper has been published in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer (IJHMT)!

This was the grand culmination of my masters thesis condensed in to a single work, and I'm so grateful to my supervisors [Dr. Sanjeev Chandra](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/chandra/) and [Dr. Cristina Amon](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/amon/) for everything.

You know, in order of effort, I think the pictures might have been third (after my literature review and the actual experiment of course). And I believe in colours. Please enjoy some of the figures from the paper below 😊.
