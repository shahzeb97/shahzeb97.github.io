## Nice!

I've been working on my master's project for quite some time now. I haven't posted much about my work in a while. These things take time and I wouldn't want to half-bake a pie. But now I get to take my findings to 2 conferences in the next 8 months! Scientific conferences like these are a great way to network so I can't wait!

## Conference 1: ITherm 2023

The **Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems** (or [ITherm](https://www.ieee-itherm.net/)) is a famous international conference dedicated to keeping the chips in your life working well. Its sponsored by IEEE's Electronic's Packaging Society (EPS) and this year is taking place in beautiful Orlando, FL at the JW Marriott Grande Lakes. This is going to be the 22nd ever ITherm conference and I'm honored to be invited.

Look out for me at the Student Poster Networking session! At some point I'll make a deeper post about the work I'm presenting, but for now, here's a picture of my experimental setup:

## Conference 2: IHTC 2023

The **Internation Heat Transfer Conference** (or [IHTC](https://ihtc17.org/), sometimes called the "Heat Transfer Olympics" is the world's premier conference in the field of Heat and Mass Transfer. It takes place every 4 years so I count myself lucky that this year it happened to take place exactly when I could possibly attend (thanks Covid). It's being held in the gorgeous city of Cape Town, South Africa! Insanely excited to be able to visit this beautiful country.

This one's a little farther out, and I'll be sure to post more about it when it gets closer! But for now, here's another picture of my experimental setup:
