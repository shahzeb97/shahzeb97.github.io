-[Bonesaw, Spider-Man (2002)](https://youtu.be/HKUDrh1vU_A)


On August 17th, 2022, the University of Toronto Climate Positive Energy (CPE) Initiative hosted its first ever [Research Day](https://cpe.utoronto.ca/cpe-wraps-up-research-day-2022/). As part of the cohort of graduate students funded in part through this initiative, I was lucky enough to be able to present a 3-minute outline of my work. 

In an earlier [post](https://shahzeb97.github.io/2022-05-06-cpe/), I mentioned that I would be participating in such an event. Presenting was an honor (and a lot of fun) and I'd like to thank the CPE initiative and technicians for making the event possible!

# My Presentation

*Recordings of the event itself don't seem to be public, though I can share my presentation slides here. Dear reader, please read through the figure set below in 3 minutes to get the full experience.*

*By the way, I hope these images load quickly! This is because I use the more efficient [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) format for all the images on my website for your convenience!*

# Other Fun Short Presentations!

For those interested, the "Three Minute Thesis" is an internationally popular competition for thesis-based graduate students. I watched several to prepare for the day, and I highly recommend them. Here is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBkaJ7KnhXk) that the University of Toronto itself sent me to be inspired by!
