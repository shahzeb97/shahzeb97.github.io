Blokes what bludgeon their wives to death with a golf trophy. Professionals have standards.\n-The Sniper (Team Fortress 2)\nThings to talk about in the post\nBackground I\u0026rsquo;ve been making a lot of drawings as a part of my job recently. This is the beauty of being in a startupm you wear many hats. I had a decent amount of experience making and releasing professional drawing packages from my internships are the City of Edmonton and CNRL. These were based on simplistic principles of GD\u0026amp;T that they have time to teach you in undergrad. But there\u0026rsquo;s a few things those undergrad-class drawings aren\u0026rsquo;t (legally speaking):\nComplete\nCoherent\nCorrect\nHere is the gist for those who aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with how engineering drawings work.\nManufacturing is imperfect. If you specify a bar must be 10 mm long, it will not be atomically perfectly 10 mm long.\nDue to (1), it is the engineer\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to clearly define what \u0026ldquo;tolerance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; on this measurement is acceptable. This is specified on the drawing where dimensions are called out with some tolerance.\nHow best to specify tolerances is not (yet) a solved problem. Organizations of very smart engineers create standards (such as ASME Y14.5 or ISO 1101) to help engineers communicate these tolerances in a clear and unambiguous way. These standards are living documents and are updated as best-practices evolve. Sometimes entire philosophies of tolerancing are developed.\nGD\u0026amp;T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing) is a language of symbols and rules that help engineers specify these tolerances in a complete, coherent, and correct manner.\nThe history of GD\u0026amp;T is quite interesting. My professor in undergrad would say that early GD\u0026amp;T is why the british navy took over the world.\nAn example engineering drawing showing GD\u0026amp;T callouts (fromt he cover of the ASME Y14.5-2018 standard)\nThe Chase After producing some bad drawings and noticing how much better the other more experience engineers were at it, I asked to take some training. Conifer agreed! They sponsored me to take the ASME Y14.5 certification course and exam through ASME. Over a couple of months, I got three ceritifications:\nASME Y14.5-2018 – GD\u0026amp;T Fundamentals\nIntroduction to Geometric Dimensioning \u0026amp; Tolerancing (GD\u0026amp;T) - Y14.5\nAdvanced Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD\u0026amp;T) - Y14.5\nMy Advanced GD\u0026amp;T Certification! Woo!\nI do want to make one thing clear, there is an actual ASME Y14.5 Certified Professional exam that is more rigorous, and if I\u0026rsquo;m correct is an in-person 4+ hour exam. This is not that. These are online certifications offered by the same organization, that teach you the material and then test you on it.\nStill, I do feel much more deadly with a drawing package now.\nAcknowledgements By the way, I do want to give a shout-out to Scott Neumann from GeoTol who helped develop this course. Really, really stellar stuff. I never made a post about my time taking the Harvard CS50X course, but Scott gives very David Malan vibes.\nAnd of course, thank you to Conifer for sponsoring me to take these courses!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:64182/posts/gdt/","summary":"The arduous journey to kind of knowing what you\u0026rsquo;re doing","title":"ASME Y14.5 Certified!"},{"content":" No food for you grad students till you grade 3,000 papers! -The Simpsons\nFree at Last, Free at Last!

A concept I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing around with was of a procedurally generated gear. I thought it would be a fun, highly mechanically-oriented, and aesthetically pleasing toy to make. It would also teach me about the engine, and in the end I would have some components that could be used in other projects.\nThe Math The unique thing about this app is that I hand-coded the mesh which describes the gear. I tried looking for code like this on the internet but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any that fit well with what I wanted, so I made it myself in a few days in GDScript.\nGears are an extremely elegant piece of machinery, I highly recommend reading about them if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. The mathematics behind the profile of the teeth has a long and illustrious history, with figures like Leonard Euler describing the involute shape we see commonly today.\nAs a crash course, spur gears like the one seen above are defined by 4 basic parameters:\nThe number of teeth.\nThe pitch, which is the number of teeth per unit length of the circumference of the gear.\nThe pressure angle, which is complicated.\nThe thickness.\nThese parameters are more useful than some intuitive ones like \u0026ldquo;diameter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tooth height\u0026rdquo;. This is because two gears of the same pressure angle and pitch will always mesh (assuming the teeth don\u0026rsquo;t interfere). So if you\u0026rsquo;re an engineer looking to buy gears from a catalog, directly comparing pitch is a lot more useful than comparing diameters and tooth heights and widths and working backwards.\nIt should be noted that the \u0026ldquo;pitch\u0026rdquo; is an imperial product. Countries on the metric system use the \u0026ldquo;module\u0026rdquo; instead, which is essentially just the inverse of the pitch, but it works the same.\nMost machine-design handbooks will have more information on this, here is the one I refer to:\nSpektor, Michael B.. (2018). Machine Design Elements and Assemblies. Industrial Press.\nNext Steps There are several ways forward I want to go with this project:\nAdd a button to change the texture of the gear, and maybe the background. Fidget toys should be customizable, after all.\nWhen you model every triangle by hand, you get a lot of control over the mesh. Random bugs I found produced hyperbolic gears, spherical hears, helical gears (not in the way you think), etc. This would be a fun exercise to play with\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to make an \u0026ldquo;agar.io\u0026rdquo; type game. Maybe something with a gear that absorbs other gears and adds them to its chain\u0026hellip;\nThe Code I\u0026rsquo;m considering uploading this to the Android Play Store, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to post a link here when I do. Friends on iOS, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a Mac to test on.\nIn the meantime, here is a demo on the web for everyone to play with on Itch.\nAnd here is the source code on GitHub!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:64182/posts/gear/","summary":"A Simple Fidget Toy in Godot","title":"Gear Toy"},{"content":" If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together\n-Unknown, African Proverb\n(The) Games Den Quick 2021 In November 2021, I participated in my first ever game jam, hosted by The Games Den, a student group from the University of Alberta with a shared passion for video games.

Right now the only version of this that exists is a private APK in my working Flutter directory, clocking in at 5,107 KB.\nFor the sake of legal safety, I never hosted this app on the Google Play Store. The app is small enough that I could host the download on this website through GitHub Pages, but I found in other testing that modern android phones didn\u0026rsquo;t love downloading unregistered APKs from random websites.\nThe eventual plan is to host the APK on my GitHub itself along with the whole project, so keen readers can jump through all the hoops to get it if they need. Right now, the codebase is a mess (and huge because Flutter), but I will edit this post when I do eventually put it up!\nClosing Thoughts I learned so much by making this app, though I know I have a lot more to learn still. Fun fact, This app also served as my final project for CS50x (a free, high-quality beginner programming course offered by Harvard which I highly recommend!).\nFor simple projects, you don\u0026rsquo;t really need to think about architectures (like MVC) and barely need to think about good programming practices. Although the simplicity and speed of development is nice, it really limits how much functionality you can add or if you ever want to add anyone to your team.

I\u0026rsquo;d like to send my humblest thanks to my supervisors Professor Cristina H. Amon and Professor Sanjeev Chandra for their support and guidance.

Here\u0026rsquo;s me on our lab website yay!\nIn the future, I hope to participate via a research presentation, in at least one Climate Positive Energy workshop, so look out for that post when it comes, dear readers.\nUpdate: It happened! Link for the post!\nMy Research Proposal Below I present the unedited research proposal I submitted to the Climate Positive Energy Committee for their consideration. I\u0026rsquo;m finding that research directives can change over time, but this still largely captures the essence of my work.\nBackground: With increasing charging speeds and higher power demands in electric vehicles (EVs), it becomes increasingly challenging to manage the waste heat generated by the EV power electronics [1]. These small chip-like devices manage the flow of electrical energy within the vehicle and become dramatically less efficient (even failing catastrophically) at high temperatures. At the same time, federal governments, energy companies, and manufacturers have set goals to increase the power density of power electronic subsystems by over 5x in the coming years to make charging quicker and more convenient for end users [2]. This immense pressure to shrink is pushing traditional, steady-state cooling systems to the limit; however, these systems are also generally intended for worst-case conditions and tend to be overdesigned compared to the average heat loads [1]. The time-varying nature of power electronic systems makes them wellsuited to novel transient thermal management strategies [3], [4]. One transient strategy involves the use of phase change materials (PCMs), which can absorb excess heat by melting during a transient heat spike while maintaining a nearly constant temperature [5]. PCMs offer a simple, passive solution to thermal management and have been adopted in building applications; however, little research has explored their use for power electronic applications and experimental verification of these studies is even more sparse [5].\nResearch Objectives: My research investigates the use of metallic PCMs for transient thermal management in high heat flux scenarios. These materials offer an inherently high thermal conductivity, making them well-suited for managing the sharp transient heat spikes expected in EV power electronics. My objectives are to develop a design methodology for PCM-based cooing solutions using a combination of numerical simulation and analytical techniques. I will then experimentally validate this methodology by designing a PCM-based cooling solution for a 100 kW EV fast-charger in a multidisciplinary project in collaboration with the University of Toronto EV (UTEV) research center. Finally, to enable a more effective codesign process, I will also develop a novel, reduced-order transient electro-thermal simulation tool. This work falls under the “carbon” theme of the CPE as it focuses on enabling the next generation of EV fast-charging infrastructure and the continued electrification of the global vehicle fleet.\nWork Plan: So far, I have designed and tested an early version of my cooling solution for low heat flux conditions and developed detailed 3D simulations using the experimentally measured properties of several candidate PCMs. I have also developed the first iteration of a reduced-order model for PCM-based cooling solutions. The next stages of my work will involve refining my simulation to study the characteristics of PCM-based cooling solutions and how their cooling performance can be increased. I will also refine my experimental setup to demonstrate effective cooling at significantly higher heat fluxes. Using this combination of numerical and experimental data, I hope to fine-tune my reduced order model and integrate it into a comprehensive electro-thermal codesign tool. This overall work plan is illustrated below in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Research steps in developing effective metallic PCM-based thermal management system.\nReferences: [1] G. Moreno, S. Narumanchi, X.

In between writing scripts for my experiments and LaTeX, I have little time to program for fun. Thankfully, my winter semester is over and the spring of 2022 seems to be delayed; I\u0026rsquo;m at a delightful intersection where no one expects anything from me and I can\u0026rsquo;t do much outside anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m sitting in my parents\u0026rsquo; lawn, watching our cats, and I want to make something.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to make something from scratch, but I do have one old project I wanted to remake: the Wikipedia Network Research Assistant. Two years ago, I wrote a version of this tool in Python when I first learned the language. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I made it suboptimally, I\u0026rsquo;d like to return to this well.\nThe Wikipedia Network Research Assistant (WNRA) (Not to be confused with the Women\u0026rsquo;s National Rifle Association)\nThe premise here is simple:\nAsk the user for a term. Look up the Wikipedia article for that term. Using some heuristic, figure out a list of the most commonly related terms. Recursively figure out what terms are related to those terms (with a configurable depth and breadth of the search). Visualize the results. I used the best libraries I could find for this kind of task: Wikipedia to scan the Wikipedia pages and NetworkX to visualize the results in a network plot. After about 90 lines of code, I was really happy with the results, presented below:\nCat\nTaylor Swift\nToronto\nThoughts on the Results It\u0026rsquo;s unreadable (I didn\u0026rsquo;t care to look any deeper in the NetworkX library to make text a little more legible. The sun is setting, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to take my cats back inside.)\nThe way networks form is surprisingly pleasing to the eye, even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend any effort on this part. Shout-out to the developers of NetworkX.\nI could apply this to other APIs: Elsevier, IEEE, and Google Scholar all seem to have some sort of API accessible through Python (even if they are not official).\nKanye West does not show up in Taylor Swift\u0026rsquo;s network. It seems he did not make her famous.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no child nodes that connect to each other. Did I forget to program that in or is that somehow just how these results look?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no visual indication here of whether there is a two-way connection between parent nodes and their children. In other words, there\u0026rsquo;s no way to know if a node is the child of its own children. In other words, is a node its own grandparent?\nThese results are extremely cherry-picked - most terms would throw errors for some reason (this seems to be a flaw with the Wikipedia API I\u0026rsquo;m using). I did find the more involved PyWikiApi, a minimalistic library for the core MediaWiki API when I started, but chose to ignore it for simplicity. This is on me.\nIt would be nice to embed more information. Things like:\na. Word count of article (relate it to the size of the node)\nb. Date Article was created (transparency of the node)\nc. Degrees of Separation from Initial Term (colour of node/edge)\nd. Number of cross-references between articles (thickness of edge)\nI will stop myself before I get too deep into potential improvements. That well would never dry.\nOn the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Python Libraries It\u0026rsquo;s been said by a million people before me, but the code-density of Python is absurd. This project took an afternoon and less than 100 lines.\nI fear not the codebase with 10k lines of C, I fear the codebase with 10k lines of Python.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:64182/posts/wikibot/","summary":"Gluing Libraries Together","title":"Wikipedia Network Graph"},{"content":" Why? Over the last semester, (the fall of 2021 for you historians), I took a class called \u0026ldquo;Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer\u0026rdquo;. Our professor, Dr. Hanif Montazeri, promised a challenging/rewarding experience; frankly, he undersold it. Over the course of 4 months, we hand-crafted our own solvers for the famous Navier-Stokes Equations. I learned a lot about vector-calculus, discretizing equations, and good programming practice, but most importantly, I made some pretty graphs.\nSolvers Specifics The solver I wrote for this class was written in Python and made extensive use of the SciPy sparse linear algebra library. I used the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm on a co-located grid. This algorithm was first proposed by Patankar and Spalding in 19731 and its implementation on a co-located grid was first described by Rhie and Chow in 19832. I promise the pretty graphs are coming.\nThe Principle Problem The scope of the course was to simulate the famous \u0026ldquo;Lid-Driven Cavity\u0026rdquo; flow problem. This is a well-known benchmark for testing fluid simulations and has been studied numerically and experimentally for decades. The idea is to simulate how a fluid would behave in a square box with an open top where fluid was rushing past:\nGeometry of lid-driven cavity flow problem by OpenFOAM\nGhia et al.3 wrote a landmark paper in 1982 studying the problem on a high resolution grid. I used their results to verify the correctness of my own solver, which are the first pretty plots I present below:\nComparison streamlines: my solver (left) and Ghia et al. (right) for lid-driven cavity flow\nMy solver seemed to be accurate enough and I was happy that it captured the small eddies forming in the corners. I also conducted a more involved grid independence study and I compared the velocity profiles through the geometric center of the cavity. These graphs are much less interesting, so for now I hope my readers can take my word for it.\nMore Interesting Problems The real beauty of having a solver is that you can go beyond the state-mandated solutions. While developing my code, I made sure to keep it general. There are five specific ways that it is generalized:\nThe number of nodes/cells in the domain can be changed The aspect ratio of the domain can be changed. The velocity at the four boundaries can be changed. The Reynolds number can be changed. The velocity at any node can be fixed to any value. Below I present some plots to demonstrate the power of this generalization where possible.\nChanging the Aspect Ratio (Point 2) Flow in a square is cool and all, but variety is the spice of life. How about some rectangles? Below I present the same lid-driven flow problem with differently shaped cavities:\nI found the taller boxes more pleasing to look at. Why not make one in the aspect ratio of a phone as a wallpaper? (For Galaxy S10e owners anyway)\nChanging the Boundary Conditions (Point 3) Let\u0026rsquo;s move beyond your average every day lid driven flow, into advanced lid driven flow. How about a container where the flow on the right and left walls is driven upwards?\nI affectionately refer to this as \u0026lsquo;bowtie flow\u0026rsquo;\nChanging the shape of the domain (Point 5) Point 5 is especially powerful; it allows us to effectively model flow in or around any shapes. Consider a box with a step in the lower left corner. Simply enough, we can model this by simulating the entire encaspsulating square, and freezing the fluids velocity to zero in places we want to exclude from our domain of interest:\nFlow around obstacles (Point 5) The really fun part about Point 5 is that we can model flow around any arbitray obstacle as well! Below I place a square in the middle of the original lid-driven cavity flow problem:\nI extended my code so I could take any black and white image and use it as a \u0026ldquo;mask\u0026rdquo; to create flow around it as an obstacle. Lets see if old spongebob is as hydrodynamic as he claims. First we start with a profile of our character:\nThen we use our editting software of choice to convert this to a black and white mask:\nAnd we plug and play:\nCan you guess this other bikini bottom resident below? Try saving the image for a hint 😉.\nClosing thoughts This project was a ton of fun to work on. I hope to eventually release this code as a webapp or command line app so users can create their own pretty streamlines. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more functionality I can see myself adding in the future, including but not limited to:\nAnimating flow over moving obstacles Pressure boundary conditions Symmetry boundary conditions Periodic boundary conditions References S.

What if we did that with melting metals?\nThe Why? Slow charging speeds are a significant technological barrier which prevent the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). A tremendous amount of heat is generated while an EV is charging. If this heat isn\u0026rsquo;t managed, it can heat up and damage the electrical components in the charger. Metallic phase change materials (MPCMs) offer a promising way to regulate device temperatures by absorbing excess heat by melting while the vehicle is charging. During the melting process, these materials maintain a nearly constant temperature and can therefore be used prevent excessive temperature spikes. They can then release this heat later by solidifying in cooler conditions.\nThe How? My project will be to design, build, and test a prototype MPCM-based cooling solution for use in EV power electronics. I will begin by using simulations to estimate the cooling performance of several potential designs. Based on the results of these simulations, the most promising designs will be built using an advanced metal spray coating technique. This technique will allow me to cheaply and quickly fabricate complex, compact cooler designs which are not possible with traditional methods. I will then experimentally test these coolers and iteratively improve on their designs based on my findings. Ultimately, my aim is to maximize the effectiveness of this cooler while minimizing its cost and size.\nThe Who? This work wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible without the support of my professors, Dr. Sanjeev Chandra and Dr. Cristina Amon. It also makes use of the advanced spray coating facility here in the CACT Lab.\nThe So What? Canada\u0026rsquo;s most recent targets call for all vehicle sales to be electric by 2035. My work could help inform the design of the next generation of EV fast charging cooling systems. This in turn would increase their convenience for users, improve consumer adoption, and allow us to meet our sustainable development goals in time.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:64182/posts/proposal/","summary":"Metallic Phase Change Materials for Fast Chargers","title":"Meltdown Imminent"},{"content":"Me Hello friends 👋!\nMy name is Shahzeb Mirza and I\u0026rsquo;m a thermal / mechanical design engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nProfessional For the last few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working at a Powertrain Startup called Conifer as a Thermal and Product Engineer.
